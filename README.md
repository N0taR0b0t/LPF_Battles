As of December 23rd 2023, neither LPF_Conflated.geojson nor sample.geojson were able to be uploaded to the WHG website.

All upload attempts fail with no error message.

Work in Progress/Will be done soon:
Descriptions Field: Modify the script to ensure that each description is an individual element in a 'descriptions' list. This list should be separate from the 'properties' dictionary.

Remove "Number of Battles": The phrase "- (Number of battles: X)" should be removed from the description.
