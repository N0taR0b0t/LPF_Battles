Most recent changes:

Removed empty quotes inside of CCodes

Modified Original.csv to delete 3 instances of doubled up CCodes

Parentheses with 3 or less characters between them are deleted

Excess spaces are replaced with a single space

NOTE:

In the original data, there are edge cases where the data is not formatted consistently:

An example would be the entry for the 1939 conflict in Albania:

Albania	Historical Conflict Event Dataset	1939 ['World War II', 'World War II']

I attempted to address unique edge cases, but unfortunately there are more than I am aware of, as I am constantly discovering new ones.
